# Overview

This is a replica of The first rival battle in Pokemon Red. Red challenges the player to a pokemon battle with his charizard, and the player fights back with squirtle. Red's attacks are random, and this code has the class already written to include bulbasaur in the mix (or swap any of the pokemon around). I made to demonstate my understanding of Kotlin Classes, functions, loops, conditionals, expressions, and Variable (both mutable and immutable), as well as working with the intelli-j environment.
